Once upon a time, there lived little red riding hood, who was on her way to meet her grandma. 
As she was walking by the forest, she decided to pick some flowers. 
Peter the fox notices red riding rood and walks over to her,
He asks little red riding hood where she was going, 
She replies "I'm going to meet my sick grandma who lives by the river".
The fox asks her to stay safe and walks away.
Red riding hood picks all the flowers and continues to walk towards her grandma's house.
